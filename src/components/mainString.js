  "I happened to see a very horrible accident It occurred last month It was between a truck and a motor cycle The road was slippery due to rain A truck was going on the road Suddenly a motor cycle overtook it with a great speed The motor cycle was being driven by two young students The riders couldn’t see the mini-truck coming from the opposite direction He applied-brakes But the motor cycle slipped The rider and the other student fell off it They had head injuries Both died there I can’t forget this accident Examinations are always fearful They are a great cause of fear anxiety tension and worry The night before the examination is really painful The students have no sleep They stop eating food They want to read and revise everything They are disturbed if someone tells them about an important question They at once read for its answer They are irritated also if anyone disturbs them They pass the whole night in tension They do not take anything in the morning They go to the examination hall on empty stomachs The scene at a Railway Platform is always enjoyable It presents a picture of mini India Last Sunday I went to the city Railway staan to see my uncle off The platform was overcrowded Passengers of all states like Rajasthan Tamilnadu Assam etc could be seen There were many stalls on the platform Small children were running here and there Coolies in red dress were going to and fro Passengers were taking tea Some were reading newspapers They were waiting for the train Soon the train came My uncle got a seat and the train started I returned home",

  "One day cricket matches have become the most favourite of cricket lovers They stop work to enjoy the match So these one-dayers have become more popular than the test matches One day match is a one-day game Time and overs are fixed Each team plays a maximum of fifty overs So there is suspense and romance in this match It seldom ends in a draw It gives results So the players try to win the match They put in their best Every ball played is filled with great fun and suspense Television has become an essential part of every house It is the cheapest source of entertainment Children find it very interesting But it has bad effects also Seeing it for long hours harms the eyes The students are left with less time to study So their studies suffer Many programmes influence young minds in a wrong way Foreign programmes are not in good taste The youth are easily attracted towards them They forget their own age-old culture Their lives are spoiled So television should be watched under the guidance of the elders Last Sunday I went to the city Railway staan to see my uncle off The platform was overcrowded Passengers of all states like Rajasthan Tamilnadu Assam etc could be seen There were many stalls on the platform Small children were running here and there Coolies in red dress were going to and fro Passengers were taking tea Some were reading newspapers They were waiting for the train Soon the train came My uncle got a seat and the train started I returned home",
